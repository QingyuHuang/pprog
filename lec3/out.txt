The machine epsilon for loats are:         1.19209e-07
The machine epsilon for double is:           2.22045e-16
The machine epsilon for long double is:      1.0842e-19
Summing up and down with floats:
sum_up_float: 15.4037
sum_down_float: 18.8079
The reason for this difference is that when summing down we are initiating the float to have a high precision whereas another method we begin at a low precision and the high precision terms at the end will be ignored. The series converges as a function of max.The sum has already converged by MAX_INT/3 since we are already beyond the precision of the float.Summing up and down with doubles:
sum_up_double: 20.9662
sum_down_double: 20.9662
Since double can handle more decimals we do not reach that point and get matching results for summing up and down with double.
